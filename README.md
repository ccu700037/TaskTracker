My project is called TaskTracker. It lets users register and log in to keep track of what tasks they need to do.
The home page displays all tasks that need to be completed along with their priority and due date (ordered by due
date). If the due date for a task has passed and it still has not been completed, it will be marked late. Users
can add tasks and edit existing tasks. When they have finished a task, they can mark it as completed and it will
no longer show up on the home page. Users can see tasks that are due within the next week on the Upcoming page.
Users can also view their history, or all the tasks they have added (included those which have been completed).
Users also have the capability to change their password.
